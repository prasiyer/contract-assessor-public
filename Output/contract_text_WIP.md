5.4. Test List  
Supplier shall provide the complete Test list in accordance with technical specification included in the Sourcing Package, detailing tests, methodologies, standards, samples size and timing.

6. GLOBAL SUPPLIER SCORECARD  
CNH Industrial apply a consistent performance assessment process valid for all its supply chain.

<!-- page_number=27 -->
The process is aimed at providing clear and measurable objectives to our suppliers, identifying performance gaps and related improvement actions, as well as recognizing those suppliers who perform in an excellent way. The performance is measured through the Global Supplier Scorecard (GSS tool), based on Key Performance Indicators (KPIs).  
As part of the GSS, Quality Performance (QP) is evaluated through an overall Quality Score that includes the contribution of different KPI as PIQ, PPM, Customer countermeasures (CSL), Supplier responsiveness on SQP usage, APQP and PPAP results. QP is calculated for each Product Family provided by Supplier.  
7. PRODUCT AND PROCESS QUALITY DEVELOPMENT  
7.1 APQP Program Review  
APQP Program Review activity is aimed to preventively emphasize any critical situation of the product/process at a particular stage of the development, checking the coherence of all the inputs defined in the sourcing phase and identifying any appropriate actions, responsible people and timing to solve the issue. Within four weeks from a formal Supplier assignment on a specific component or components family, the APQP Program Review Kick Off can be executed, with the mandatory Supplier participation together with CNH Industrial department involved in the technical assessment.  
APQP Program review must be executed for all the new purchased parts bought externally classified as High Risk, during Platform APQP Risk assessment, as defined in PUR 30  
7.2 Process Audit  
As far as series production is concerned, the Process Audit activity is aimed to identify and to prevent any Quality issue in supplier processes, and to check the coherence of all the inputs (defined both in the sourcing process and in the Program Reviews in terms of technical solutions, timing and requirements), with what really implemented.  
The Process Audit is a fundamental step of the Advanced Product Quality Planning (APQP), also applicable in Production Phase.  
Supplier agrees that CNH Industrial Supplier Quality may, upon maximum 03 (Three) working days advance notice to Supplier, inspect, directly or by means of entities designated by CNH Industrial, Supplier’s manufacturing processes and facilities, in order to check the Supplier’s compliance with Customer requirements. Supplier shall therefore assure the access to its supplier manufacturing processes and facilities.  
7.3 Production Part Approval Process  
Supplier, before commencing the delivery of a new or modified Product, shall have performed all tests and inspections agreed or required and all additional tests and inspections as necessary to ensure, control and establish the Compliance with Customer requirements.  
All Suppliers are required to develop timely the roll out of the Project and they shall pass the forecasted gates (Program Reviews, Process Audits, Production Part Approval) in according with Customer launch milestones and planning date.  
For the initial qualification and the periodic requalification of the Products, new or modified, shall be fulfilled the rules set forth in the CNH Industrial Procedure (PUR 30) Production Part Approval Process (PPAP).  
Consequence of this approval process is the Customer acceptance of the Part Submission Warrant or Interim Recovery Worksheet, as per Procedure PUR 30, mandatory for shipment authorization and material usage in the Customer plants. Moreover, any fail will result in performance penalization.  

## 8. CURRENT PRODUCT MANAGEMENT  
8.1 Non-Conforming Products Managements  
If any Supplier’s products delivered to CNH Industrial do not comply with CNH Industrial requirements, CNH Industrial shall have the right to communicate the issue through SQP EVO* system issuing a SQP Bill to supplier describing the problem in detail. Supplier is required to provide  

Page 27 of 55

<!-- page_number=28 -->
containment and corrective action, in accordance with QPS 08018 procedure, exclusively through SQP EVO usage.  
Supplier will evaluate in agreement with CNH Industrial the possible reworking of the not-conforming material, after technical and economical evaluation. Supplier can rework the material after or during the selection, following authorized working instructions.  
In agreement with the Supplier, CNH Industrial can start the authorized reworking operation autonomously, charging the relevant costs to the Supplier.  
* SQP is a CNH Industrial computer system suitable for the communication and management of non-conformities through a report ("SQP Bills") sent from CNH Industrial production plants to suppliers. Any economic recovery due to the return of the material or reworking activity is not a process included in the system.

## 8.2 Supply Quality Performance Monitoring  
Each Supplier’s Senior Management shall commit to maintain and continuously improve quality. CNH Industrial monitors the performance of each Supplier Code / Product Family Code using SQP EVO System. SQP EVO monitors performance data for PIQ, PQ, PPM, and other indicators as per Standard QPS 08018/I. Suppliers are expected to monitor their quality performance on-line through SQP EVO System.

## 8.3 Countermeasures  
At any time that CNH Industrial determines that a Product or Supplier’s process do not comply with Quality Requirements or specifications or drawings, CNH Industrial can initiate a CSL (Control Shipping Level) 1, 2 or 3, which will require Supplier (in case of CSL1) or third party (in case of CSL 2, and 3) to inspect certain Product/Supplier characteristics and processes, identified by CNH Industrial Supplier Quality in writing, and where necessary develop a corrective action plan, all at Supplier’s expenses.  
CSL 1, 2 or 3 are steps of the process aimed to support Supplier in the solution of the quality problems that caused a non-conforming supply. Those three Levels are differentiated according to the severity and occurrence of the non-conformities detected in the supply and are described in CNH Industrial’s procedure. In the most serious cases of non-conforming supply, CNH industrial shall always have the right to put Supplier in the New Business Hold (NBH) status, avoiding its participation to the sourcing procedure of new businesses or the awarding of the businesses concerned by the current sourcing, for the whole duration of the NBH measure.

In the LRB document there is a secondary sheet named "PkgPhoto_General_Info" where it’s possible to see / add pictures or other packaging details.

4. ANNEX  
4.1 Incoterms  
Incoterms are universal guidelines for understanding obligations, risks and logistics requirements in international transactions. They define where each part needs to arrange delivery, insurance, custom duties and pickup of the goods. It also distinguishes who is responsible for paying for any damage to the goods during transport and ensuring the goods through customs clearance.

| EXW | What supplier has to do is make the product available at the warehouse for the buyer. The buyer arranges delivery, insurance, duties and all costs to pick up the goods from the seller warehouse. |
|-----|---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------|
| FCA | It is like EXW but in this case the supplier needs to deliver the goods to the carrier chosen by the buyer to transport the products.                                   |
| FOB | Supplier is responsible for delivering the goods on board the ship. CNHi is responsible for the main carriage/freight, cargo insurance and other costs and risks.     |
| CIP | Supplier covers the costs of duties, freight and insurance to the destination port. Once the goods are placed on the ship then the risk is transferred to the buyer.  |
| DAP | Supplier must provide the delivery of goods to the final point at destination. The Supplier has to guarantee the required delivery frequency. Duty clearance are on buyer’s charge. |
| DDP | Supplier delivers the goods to the buyer warehouse and pays country duties.                                                                                          |

## 4.2 Feeding policies
Design and management of assembly lines requires a decision about the way components and subassemblies are delivered to assembly stations. There are different feeding policies as below:

## 4.3 Packaging types

| JIS | The material is produced in sequence (JIS 1) or only sequenced from a buffer by the Supplier (JIS 2), in phase with the consumption sequence of CNHi plant assembly line. |
|-----|--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------|
| JIT | The material is provided without being sequenced, to replenish the assembly line consumption. The quantity to be delivered will keep the stock levels into fixed range. |
| IF  | The materials are unloaded and stocked in CNHi plant warehouse.                                                                                                   |

In the LRB document 3 different types of returnable containers can be indicated:

- Supplier ownership  
  In case of supplier ownership, the Supplier has to calculate the container investment; he will also be responsible for the retooling of containers, their ordinary and extraordinary maintenance, cleaning and repair.

Page 37 of 55

Supplier’s Initials ..............................                      CNHI’s Initials ...............................

<!-- page_number=38 -->
- CNHi ownership  
These containers are owned and purchased by the CNHi plant. The maintenance and replacement of missing or heavily damaged parts will be responsibility of CNHi  

- CCM (only EUROPE plants)  
These containers are owned and purchased by the CNHi plant, supplier must pay a rental fee. The acceptance of the CCM condition for the racks means that the Supplier will use standardized CCM containers when requested and agreed with CNHI. General rules of CCM racks' operations are specified inside the Agreement between the parts (CCM, Material Suppliers).  

Physical flow  

1) The supplier ships the containers with material inside to the plant. This operation must be registered by the supplier on CCM web tool.  
During the transport, no rental fee is calculated.  
2) The theoretical date of container receiving is calculated adding the standard transit time (already defined for each routing) to the shipment registration date. Starting from this day CCM calculates the fee for each container for the retention period into the plant.  
3) After the container has been used, the empty container must be moved to the Container Service Centre (CSC), a dedicated area inside the plant where the containers can be moved after their usage.  
After the containers are moved into the CSC, they are available for CCM to be picked up and sent to suppliers.  
After the CSC movement registration has been performed CCM stops to calculate the rental fee for the moved containers.  
4) When a supplier asks for some containers, CCM checks their availability in the several CSCs of the plants and gives to Inbound Logistics dept. the information to arrange the transport. During the transport no rental fee is applied.

<!-- page_number=39 -->
5) CCM calculates the theoretical date of empty containers receiving adding the standard transit time to the shipment date of empty containers from the CSC. Starting from this date, CCM considers a "no fee period" that normally is 3 days after which CCM starts to calculate a rental fee for the retention period of the containers inside the supplier plant.
